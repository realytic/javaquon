JavaQuON is a lightweight implementation of the Quad-Tree Based Overlay Protocol for Distributed Virtual Worlds (QuON) as published in the corresponding paper located at http://www.pap.vs.uni-due.de/MMVE09/papers/p4.pdf. JavaQuON allows peers that want to participate in a shared virtual world to efficiently keep track of all other peers inside their area of interest. In order to keep things simple and fast, the protocol implementation is based on UDP. So far, sophisticated mechanisms like backup neighbors and dynamic adaptation of the area of interest are not implemented, yet.
